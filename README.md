### WARNING: This repo is pointing to a [feature branch](https://github.com/textileio/go-threads/pull/498) of `go-threads` that handles identities as Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and should be considered alpha. The [textile repo](https://github.com/textileio/textile) contains the non-DID-based bucket implementation currently compatible with [Textile's public hub](https://cloud.hub.textile.io/#/access). DID-based buckets will be integrated into the hub mid 2021. In the meantime, you can still use this repo for standalone bucket peers.

## Security

Go-Mail is still under heavy development and no part of it should be used before a thorough review of the underlying code and an understanding APIs and protocols may change rapidly. There may be coding mistakes, and the underlying protocols may contain design flaws. Please [let us know](mailto:contact@textile.io) immediately if you have discovered a security vulnerability.
